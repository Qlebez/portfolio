            <h2>Minishell</h2>
            <h4>
                As the name suggest it, Minishell is a minimal shell that I have created with a team of 3 people. It is a project from the 2nd year of my computer science degree.
                We had to recreate a shell with some basic functionalities like the builtins echo, cd, pwd, export, unset and env. We also had to handle the PATH variable and the errors.
                We used the C language.

            <h2>Management Webapp</h2>
            <h4>
                During my internship in Germany, I worked with a team of 3 mechanical engineers and in partnership with Premium Aerotec, we created a Webapp
                to manage there milling machines. Through real-time data, we were able to check the status of the machines, the number of pieces produced, 
                the number of pieces remaining, the time remaining, etc. The engineering team provide me the technical expertise and I was in charge of the development with a team of 2 others french students
                We used the Laravel framework with PHP and the React library with JavaScript and TailwindCSS for the design.
